# Level Ground 
This project is a wireframe developed for a mixed martial arts gym. The top section contains a banner with the site mission statement, logo, and a link to a video demonstrating a typical class. There are additional sections showing different product offerings and a section for volunteer opportunities. The bottom section contains affiliated links, site map, copyright info, and contact information.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

To make this wireframe we are going to be using HTML and CSS to markup. There are 4 main sections which represent the most important information. Flexbox is used to align the content centered. The headers are displayed the most promimently. Buttons are used as hyperlinks. The color scheme is meant to be a neutral blue theme.

## Optimizations


## Lessons Learned:

A great takeaway for this project would be to have the most important headers displayed promimently to be the most eye catching. A neutral color scheme is great for a small business that wants to display contact information, a mission statement, founder images and some recently completed work.
